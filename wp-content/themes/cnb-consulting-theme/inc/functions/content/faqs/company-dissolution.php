            'question' => 'What happens if I just stop operating without formal dissolution?',
            'answer' => 'Your business remains legally active, creating ongoing tax obligations, potential penalties, and personal liability exposure. States may also dissolve your business involuntarily, which can affect your good standing and future business activities.'
        ),
        array(
            'question' => 'How long does the dissolution process take?',
            'answer' => 'Basic dissolution typically takes 4-8 weeks, depending on state requirements and creditor notification periods. Complex dissolutions with multiple assets or creditor issues may take 3-6 months to complete properly.'
        ),
        array(
            'question' => 'Can I dissolve my business if it has debts?',
            'answer' => 'Yes, but debts must be handled properly during dissolution. We help negotiate with creditors, prioritize payments, and ensure legal compliance. Proper dissolution can provide protection from personal liability for business debts.'
        ),
        array(
            'question' => 'What tax obligations do I have during dissolution?',
            'answer' => 'You must file final tax returns, pay any outstanding taxes, close tax accounts with federal and state agencies, and handle final payroll obligations. We ensure all tax requirements are met to avoid future penalties.'
        ),
        array(
            'question' => 'Will dissolution affect my personal credit?',
            'answer' => 'Proper dissolution can actually protect your personal credit by preventing ongoing business obligations from affecting you personally. However, any personal guarantees on business debts will still need to be addressed.'
