            'question' => 'Do I need to file a tax return to get an ITIN?',

            'question' => 'Can I mail my original documents to the IRS?',

            'question' => 'Does an ITIN expire?',
            'answer' => 'Yes, ITINs expire if not used on a tax return for three consecutive years. ITINs issued before 2013 have also expired and need renewal. We can help with ITIN renewals too.'

            'answer' => 'No, ITINs are for tax purposes only and do not authorize work in the US. You need proper work authorization from USCIS to legally work in the United States.'
